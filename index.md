### Network Intrusion Detection

<!-- <img src="projects/Network_intrusion/figures/screenshots/tsne_2D_dark_5000.png?raw=true"/> -->
<img src="projects/Network_intrusion/GIF-network_intrusion.gif">

This project develops a machine learning-based classifier to effectively distinguish between intrusive (malicious) and non-intrusive (benign) network traffic. Advanced preprocessing and SMOTE are applied to improve detection capabilities, resulting in a highly effective system for identifying attacks.

### Automatic Detection of Legal Query Series - State Council of France

<img src="./projects/Conseil_d_etat/CE_logo.png?raw=true"/>

As part of my Master's in Data Science at Université Paris-Saclay, this project was conducted during my apprenticeship at the Conseil d'État. It focused on automating the classification of legal query series, significantly enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of the institution's data management processes.

### Deep Contrastive Learning

<img src="projects/SimCLR/SimCLR.png?raw=true"/>
This project uses SimCLR, a contrastive learning method, to train a model on the MNIST dataset with minimal labeled data. By leveraging unsupervised techniques, it enhances feature representation and achieves a 7% improvement in accuracy over traditional models.

### Turnover Prediction

<img src="./projects/Turnover/turnover.png?raw=true"/>

This project focuses on predicting employee turnover within a company using survival analysis and classification methods in R. By comparing models like Cox proportional hazards and Survival Random Forests against traditional classification approaches, the goal is to predict an employee’s risk of leaving within a year, enhancing strategic human resource planning.
